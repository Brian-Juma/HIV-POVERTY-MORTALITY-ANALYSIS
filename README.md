# HIV, Poverty and Mortality Analysis  

## Overview  
This repository contains the analysis and code for my Data Science Internship Assessment at the **Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA), University of Nairobi**.  

The project examines the intersection of HIV burden, multidimensional poverty, and child mortality in Africa, with a focus on the East African Community (EAC). The analyses use integrated datasets from the **WHO Global Observatory**, **World Bank** and **UN IGME**.  

## Project Objectives  
- **HIV Trends and Poverty Linkages**  
  - Identify countries contributing to 75% of the global HIV burden and visualize their trends over time.  
  - Conduct similar analyses at the WHO regional level.  
  - Examine the relationship between HIV prevalence and multidimensional poverty indicators using mixed-effects models.  

- **Child Mortality in East Africa**  
  - Visualize under-five and neonatal mortality rates in EAC countries using spatial data.  
  - Plot mortality trends over time and identify countries with the highest rates.  

## Data Sources  
- **HIV Data:** WHO Global Observatory (2000â€“2023)  
- **Poverty Data:** World Bank Multidimensional Poverty Indicators  
- **Child Mortality Data:** UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME)  
- **Spatial Data:** GADM shapefiles (www.gadm.org)  

## Key Findings  
- **HIV and Poverty Analysis**  
  - **Top Contributors:** Identified countries contributing to 75% of the global HIV burden and visualized their trends (2000â€“2023).  
  - **Poverty Linkages:** Improved sanitation was modestly associated with lower HIV prevalence, while higher educational attainment correlated with higher reported prevalence likely due to greater access to testing and awareness.  

- **Child Mortality in East Africa**  
  - **Highest Rates:** South Sudan had the highest under-five mortality rate (773 per 1,000 live births), while Rwanda recorded the highest neonatal mortality rate (70.2 per 1,000 live births).  
  - **Trends:** Both under-five and neonatal mortality rates have declined over time across the EAC.
