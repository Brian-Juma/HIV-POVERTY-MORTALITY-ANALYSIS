# HIV-POVERTY-MORTALITY-ANALYSIS

## Overview  
This repository contains the analysis and code for my **Data Science Internship Assessment** for the **Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA), University of Nairobi**.  

The project focuses on analyzing **HIV burden, multidimensional poverty, and child mortality in Africa, with a specific focus on East Africa** using integrated datasets from the **WHO Global Observatory**, **World Bank**, and **UN IGME**.

## Project Objectives  

### HIV Trends and Poverty Linkages  
- Identify countries contributing to 75% of the global HIV burden and visualize their trends over time.  
- Perform a similar analysis at the WHO regional level.  
- Analyze the relationship between HIV prevalence and multidimensional poverty indicators using mixed-effects models.  

### Child Mortality in East Africa  
- Visualize under-five and neonatal mortality rates in East African Community (EAC) countries using spatial data.  
- Plot trends over time and identify countries with the highest mortality rates.

## Data Sources  
- **HIV Data**: WHO Global Observatory (2000â€“2023)  
- **Poverty Data**: World Bank Multidimensional Poverty Indicators  
- **Child Mortality Data**: UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME)  
- **Spatial Data**: GADM shapefiles ([www.gadm.org](https://www.gadm.org))

## Key Findings  

### HIV and Poverty Analysis  
- **Top Contributors**: Identified countries contributing to 75% of the global HIV burden and visualized their trends from 2000â€“2023.  
- **Poverty Linkages**: Improved sanitation was modestly associated with lower HIV prevalence, while higher educational attainment showed a positive association, likely due to increased testing and awareness.  

### Child Mortality in East Africa  
- **Highest Mortality Rates**: South Sudan had the highest under-five mortality rate (773 per 1,000 live births), while Rwanda had the highest neonatal mortality rate (70.2 per 1,000 live births).  
- **Trends**: Visualized declining trends in both under-five and neonatal mortality rates across EAC countries over time.
